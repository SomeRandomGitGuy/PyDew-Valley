# PyDew-Valley
^ This is a tempoary name 

This game is currently in development

Amazing Features Include:
- A river
- A player
- An ever growing pollution problem
- And, finally a shop to buy renewable resources to outpower the coal plant

This game is like a cross between Stardew Valley(Art Style) and Terraria(Growing Infection)

I hope you enjoy the game :)
